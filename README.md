# pyHTMLProofer

Check for website and static HTML pages for link rot.


## Features

pyHTMLProofer can be used on
1. Static HTML pages (typically generated by an SSG). You can specify either files or directories to be checked.
2. Webpages, you can specify a URL/link to be checked.


pyHTMLProofer at the moment does the following:

1. Checks for broken internal links in HTML files
2. Checks if external links in HTML or website link are valid

You can read more details below in [What's Tested?](#whats-tested) section.

## Credits

The inspiration was by Ruby based [HTMLProofer](https://github.com/gjtorikian/html-proofer) and lack of Python based alternatives. Although, [pyHTMLProofer](https://github.com/rehanhaider/pyhtmlproofer) is not a Python rewrite, instead it focuses on solving problems that I encountered while maintaining [CloudBytes/Dev>](https://cloudbytes.dev) website.
